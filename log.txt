Sometimes people do not go to the hospital because they do not have any pain at all.
But it is possible to have a heart attack without pain.
It’s also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.
But don’t be surprised if you do not find out right away why you have pain.

There are also tests your doctor or nurse can do to find out what is going on.
They can collect breast milk fast, but usually not as fast as hospital pumps.
Personal pumps can come in a carrying case.
They can be powered by hand, batteries, or electricity.
You do not have to wash your breasts or nipples.
Your nipples should not rub against the tunnel part of these pieces.
Usually, let-down happens soon after you start pumping.
Or their lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
But some people start radiation therapy after their chemotherapy is done.
This can kill the cancer in the lungs.
Most people get radiation therapy at the same time as their chemotherapy treatment.
But people might also have radiation that is aimed at the brain, even if they do not have cancer in the brain.
Follow-up tests usually include exams and imaging tests such as chest x-rays or CT scans.
People who survive lung cancer have a greater chance of getting lung cancer again if they smoke.
But most problems can be treated so that women can keep breastfeeding.
But don’t let too much milk out or pump for more than 2 to 5 minutes.
Nipple pain that lasts the whole breastfeeding session is usually not normal.
Start with the breast that has the blocked milk duct.
They do this to check for a swishing sound that occurs when the artery is partly blocked.
But many people have serious problems after a stroke.
TIAs are basically strokes that last only a short time.
But they do not cause brain damage.
TIAs happen when a blood vessel in the brain gets clogged briefly and then reopens.
People who have TIAs can have the symptoms of a stroke, but the symptoms go away in a short time.
This treatment is most appropriate for people who have had a TIA or stroke and who have a lot of plaque in their carotid arteries.
It is also appropriate for some people who have not had a stroke or TIA but who have a lot of plaque in their carotid arteries.
Some people have this test before they show any symptoms.
Most people die 10 to 30 years after the symptoms begin.
But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.
Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the woman’s last period.
Black women are more likely to give birth early than white, Latino, or Asian women.
They eventually become painful.
These are contractions that happen several minutes apart.
If you think you might be in labor, call your doctor, nurse, or midwife.
They are usually not too painful and don’t get stronger or more frequent over time.
They often go away when you lie down or rest.
You should also call if you have blood or fluid leaking from your vagina, or if you have more than 6 contractions in 1 hour.
Symptoms occur only at certain times of the year.
When a person has a seasonal allergy, his or her immune system acts as if the substance is harmful to the body.
It might take an hour or two to figure out whether you are in preterm labor.
Some women who have preterm labor end up having their baby at the normal time.
These medicines are called “tocolytic agents.”
If you are less than 34 weeks pregnant, your doctor might also give you medicines called steroids.
These medicines will speed up the growth of your baby’s lungs.
If you do end up giving birth early, your healthcare team can take steps to protect the health of the baby.
This will help the baby to breathe if he or she is born early.
If you have a c-section, you will be given anesthesia so that you won’t feel pain.
Then the doctor will make an incision (cut) in your belly and remove the baby from your uterus (womb).
About 1 in 3 babies in the United States is born this way.
Most babies come out of their mothers’ vaginas.
This is called “vaginal delivery.”
The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste.
In placenta previa, this organ blocks the way to the vagina.
Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam.
He or she might order other tests, such as a skin test.
A skin test can help figure out what you are allergic to.
Then, he or she will watch your skin to see if it turns red and bumpy.
The medicine should make your contractions stronger.
With regional anesthesia, you stay awake.
Under general anesthesia, you are asleep.
Most women go home after 3 days, but will have some pain.
This usually lasts for just a short time.
Effective treatments exist, but they work best if you start them soon after your symptoms start.
Ask your doctor if a vaginal delivery is possible for you.
The placenta is the organ inside a pregnant woman’s uterus that brings her fetus nutrients and oxygen, and carries away waste.
This test is done between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy.
If your CVS results come back normal, that does not necessarily mean the fetus has no genetic problems.
This can cause problems for later pregnancies.
Problems are rare, but they can happen.
Most people with Bell’s palsy start to get better within 3 weeks of when their symptoms start.
But it can take them up to 6 months to get completely back to normal.
The tube also has tools attached, so the doctor can take samples of tissue to look at under the microscope.
They might happen just once.
For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube into your rectum (the lower part of the large intestine) and threads it up into your colon.
These reduce swelling in mild cases.
It takes about 3 weeks before they start working.
These medicines work on your immune system to protect your colon from damage.
People who have this surgery can no longer have bowel movements in the normal way.
Instead, their bowel movements come out through a hole in their belly.
A plastic bag catches the waste.
After this surgery, the doctor reconnects the intestine to the anus.
As many as 9 out of 10 pregnant women feel nauseous early in pregnancy.
Even though it is called “morning” sickness, symptoms can happen any time of day.
A smaller number actually throw up.
They are often worst around the second and third months.
Symptoms usually start during the first 2 months of pregnancy.
But some women feel bad for much longer.
This is even more of a concern if there is blood in your vomit.
For example, most people with giant cell arteritis also take a low dose of aspirin every day to prevent vision loss or a stroke.
Some are safe to take while pregnant.
But people with severe MS can have most or all of them.
That might include stuffy rooms, strong smells, hot places, loud noises, or not sleeping enough.
There are medicines that can help with nausea and vomiting.
Doctors give different names to MS, depending on how it progresses.
Talk with your doctor before taking anything.
Some women feel better if they wear them.
These bands are supposed to reduce morning or motion sickness.
It is OK to gain weight slowly in the beginning of your pregnancy.
Even women with the worst symptoms usually have healthy babies.
Most women should gain between 25 and 35 pounds by the end.
But some people have problems that last even after an attack gets better.
An MRI is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of your body.
People with certain health problems, such as high blood pressure, should not take decongestants.
Also, people should not use decongestant nose sprays for more than 3 days in a row.
Using these nose sprays for more than 3 days in a row can make symptoms worse.

In many cases, doctors can diagnose MS only after seeing how symptoms and test results change over time.
But they do not cure the disease.
And it’s not clear whether they slow it down.
In most people, the disease progresses very slowly.
Usually, allergy shots are given every week or month by an allergy doctor.
It is also important to talk with your doctor or nurse about when and how to use your medicines.
He or she might do a blood test to check for the infection.
He or she might do a blood test to check for CMV.
If you get symptoms at the same time every year, talk with your doctor or nurse.
Some people can prevent symptoms by starting their medicine a week or two before that time of the year.
Sometimes it also causes swelling in joints such as the knees, hands, and feet.
It usually occurs in people age 50 and older.
This condition affects blood vessels, usually in the head and sometimes in the neck.
For example, if you have giant cell arteritis, your doctor might order a test called a chest X-ray every year to check the blood vessels in your chest.
In other words, the center of what you look at often looks clear.
But things that are off to the side do not.
Glaucoma eye drops can keep you from losing your vision.
Some people also have pain in the scalp when it is touched.
But they only work if you follow the instructions on how to use them.
Or they might be embarrassed to breastfeed.
Doctors recommend that women breastfeed their babies for at least 1 year (12 months) when possible.
After 6 months, doctors recommend that women still breastfeed.
But babies can start eating and drinking other foods, too.
They might think that it is easier to feed a baby formula.
But it cannot undo damage that has already been done.
But they often occur together.
That’s important, because treatment for glaucoma can prevent or slow down vision loss.
Usually, these conditions last between one and three years.
It can also keep babies from getting ear or lung infections.
If your doctor or nurse suspects that you have polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis, he or she will do an exam and order blood tests.

When you press the burn, it turns white.
He or she might also order an X-ray, MRI, or other imaging test.
The burn will turn white when you press it.
Your skin will hurt with a light touch or if the air temperature changes.
Superficial partial-thickness burns take 7 to 21 days to heal, and the area of skin that was burned might be darker or lighter than it used to be.
The burn will hurt when you press it hard, but it will not turn white.
This kind of burn takes more than 21 days to heal, and will probably leave a scar.
Many women who had surgery to make their breasts smaller or bigger can make enough milk, but some can’t.
But some women buy or rent a breast pump later on.
Your doctor will treat this kind of burn with surgery.
You might also need to stay in the hospital for a time and take medicines.
Infected skin gets more and more red, is painful, and may leak pus.
During a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece of a blood vessel from under your skin on the side of the head.
He or she then looks at the tissue under a microscope.
If your burn forms blisters, cover it with a clean, non-stick bandage and change the bandage once or twice a day.
If you have a more serious burn, your doctor might give you a stronger medicine for pain or apply special bandages.
For a severe burn, your doctor might suggest surgery to repair the area that was burned.
He or she might also prescribe medicines to prevent infection.
But most people need to take steroids for one to two years.
(These are not the same steroids that athletes take to build muscle.
These steroids reduce swelling and ease pain.) Many people feel better after taking their first dose.
The symptoms of most forms of muscular dystrophy start in childhood. But some forms start in adulthood.
Circumcision is usually done when a boy is between 1 and 10 days old.
In the United States, circumcision is common.
Circumcision is a common tradition in some religions.
In the end, you will have to decide for yourself what is right for your family.
Your doctor won’t tell you what to do.
Then the doctor uses special tools to cut off the foreskin.
This article covers the most common type of nerve damage caused by diabetes.
Once people feel symptoms in the middle of their lower legs, they might also start to feel symptoms in their hands.
Your doctor can usually tell if you have nerve damage by talking with you and doing an exam.
Sometimes, a doctor will do a test to check how well a person’s nerves are working.
Instead, it attaches to a place in the body that it should not attach to and starts to grow.
But the embryo does not attach to the uterine lining.
Even though the embryo gets bigger, it cannot grow into a baby.
As the embryo gets bigger, it can cause pain and bleeding and lead to other problems.
When this happens, doctors also call it a “tubal pregnancy.”
In rare cases, the embryo can also attach to the cervix, ovary, or the inside of the belly.

It does not usually cause symptoms.
But it can be serious.
The bottom number is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is relaxed.
“Prehypertension” is a term doctors or nurses use as a warning.
People with prehypertension do not yet have high blood pressure.
But their blood pressure is not as low as it should be for good health.
He or she may be able to lower your dose or switch you to another medicine.
For instance, your doctor or nurse might say that your blood pressure is “140 over 90.”
If it causes side effects, do not just stop taking it.
Instead, talk to your doctor or nurse about the problems it causes.
If cost is a problem, mention that too.
He or she may be able to put you on a less expensive medicine.
Taking your blood pressure medicine can keep you from having a heart attack or stroke, and it can save your life!
People who check their own blood pressure at home do better at keeping it low and can sometimes even reduce the amount of medicine they take.
But, if a woman using an IUD does get pregnant, she is at high risk of ectopic pregnancy should have her doctor to check for ectopic pregnancy.
The pain tells them that they need to treat their cut so that it can heal.
Over time, this can cause a person’s foot to have an abnormal shape.
To better control your blood sugar, your doctor might prescribe another diabetes medicine or recommend that you take your diabetes medicine more often.
Never go barefoot.
It can also prevent a mild problem from turning into a serious one.
Ask your doctor to do any procedures that could involve cutting the skin, such as removing an ingrown toenail.
Do not cut cuticles or pop blisters.
Other times, doctors need to repeat the tests every few days to know for sure if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy.
Put a moisturizing cream or lotion on the tops and bottoms of your feet.
Look for cuts, blisters, swelling, or redness.
Women who are treated with medicine need follow-up blood tests for a few weeks to make sure that the treatment worked.
But women have a higher chance of having an ectopic pregnancy if they get a lot of infections that you catch during sex.
That way, he or she can follow your pregnancy to make sure everything is normal.
There are different treatments, depending on how serious the problem is.
But let your doctor or nurse know if you are trying to get pregnant.
He or she should also do a quick check of your feet at every visit.
Meningitis happens when the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord (called the “meninges”) get infected.
This can occur after a child has an infection in another part of the body.
The germs can travel through the blood to the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord.
“Bacterial meningitis” is caused by bacteria.
“Viral meningitis” is caused by viruses.
Viral meningitis is usually less serious, and does not usually lead to long-term brain problems or death.
Children with bacterial meningitis may have seizures or red-purple spots on the skin.
Children with viral meningitis may have a runny nose, muscle aches, cough, or a red-pink rash.
Doctors can do different tests to figure out if a child has meningitis and what type it is.
For example, he or she might do a “culture.” This is a test to find out if yeast is present and if so, which type of yeast you have.
Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.
This causes the heart to lag behind in its job of moving blood throughout the body.
As a result, fluid backs up in the body, and the organs in the body do not get as much blood as they need.
This can lead to symptoms, such as swelling, trouble breathing, and feeling tired.
It also shows the general shape of the heart and large blood vessels in the chest.
It can show whether you have an abnormal heartbeat or had a heart attack in the past.
These are some of the things that can cause heart failure.
Physical activity makes the heart pump harder and increases the heart’s need for blood.
During this test, the doctor inserts a thin tube into a large artery in your leg and threads it up to your heart.
Then the doctor injects a dye that shows up on X-ray pictures.
The pictures can show whether any of the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked.
When you have heart failure, sudden weight gain is a sign that your body could be holding on to too much fluid.
You might need a change in your medicines.
But do not exercise if your symptoms are bothering you a lot.
But those treatments are only for people with extreme weight problems who have not been able to lose weight through diet and exercise.
They can reduce the chances that you will need to go to the hospital, have a heart attack, or die.
These children have blood pressure that is greater than normal, but is not yet high blood pressure.
During the exam, he or she will check the blood pressure in your child’s arms and legs.
Other times, there is no known cause.
Adults with high blood pressure have a greater chance of having a heart attack or stroke.
Heart failure is a type of heart problem in which the heart cannot pump normally.
A nutritionist is an expert on food and eating.
Aerobic exercise includes activities such as walking, running, swimming, or biking.
They work by preparing the body to fight the germs that cause the infections.
Your doctor or nurse will tell you if there are activities your child should not do.
Children who breathe in smoke can get heart problems.
On each visit, he or she will check your child’s blood pressure.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems with treatment.
An HPV infection can also cause genital warts in women and men.
An ICD can sense and treat certain abnormal heartbeats.
But sometimes, a person’s heartbeat can suddenly become abnormal.
The heartbeat could be too slow, too fast, or out of rhythm.
People who have a lot of sex partners have a higher chance of getting an HPV infection.
And often, the infection will get better on its own.
When the ICD senses an abnormal heartbeat, the battery creates an electrical shock or shocks that travel through wires to the heart.
People with a long-lasting HPV infection have a higher chance of getting cervical cancer or genital warts.
These problems usually happen many years after a person is first infected.
It’s possible that your doctor or nurse will take samples of pus from one of your blisters.
Both involve getting 3 doses over 6 months.
This can get the heart to beat normally again.
Both HPV vaccines come in shots.
Side effects can occur when a doctor puts in an ICD.
People who have had an ICD for a long time can also have side effects.
Your doctor will talk with you about the different side effects that can occur.
But girls and women can get the vaccine any time from age 9 to 26.
He or she will look at the record of your heartbeats and might decide to make changes to the way your ICD works.
That’s why it is better to get the HPV vaccine before you have sex for the first time.
Your doctor will tell you how long you need to wait before you drive again.
The HPV vaccine can’t cure an HPV infection that a person already has.
If you have already had sex, talk with your doctor or nurse.
For example, some people with an ICD should not walk through a metal detector at the airport.
He or she might recommend that you get the HPV vaccine anyway, because it could still help you.
If you feel worried or sad, let your doctor or nurse know so that he or she can help.
For example, people with an ICD should not have a type of imaging test called an MRI scan.
It can also cause people to pass out, but this is uncommon.
But it is not perfect.
To keep from getting or spreading a disease that is spread through sex, you should use a type of protection called a condom.
Most women are checked using a test called a “pap smear” starting at age 21 or within 3 years of having sex for the first time.

Doctors and nurses sometimes call it MRSA or "Mursa" for short.
This type of infection is caused by a fungus called “candida.”
Candida is a type of fungus called “yeast,” so some people call thrush a yeast infection of the mouth and throat.

He or she might also run a Q-tip (called a “swab”) along your tongue or cheek and collect some fluid.
That way, he or she can send the fluid to the lab and have it checked for yeast.
(A lozenge is like a candy that you suck on.) If these options do not work, people sometimes take a pill that has medicine to kill yeast.
People who have severe infections or other health problems sometimes get the pill right away.
Low back pain can be scary. But it is almost never serious.
Raynaud disease does not always cause symptoms, but people can get an “attack” when it is cold out, when they feel stressed, or when they are startled.
But you may need to avoid sports or other physical activities for at least a month. That's because mono can cause one of the organs in your body to become bigger than it should be.
They pass the pregnancy tissue at home, through the vagina.
If you don’t know what to do, talk to someone you trust.
This only works until about 9 weeks into a pregnancy.
It is also called “medication abortion.”
Women who have a medical abortion make 2 visits to the clinic to get medicine.
This is the best choice after about 8 weeks of pregnancy.
It can work earlier in the pregnancy, too.
A few hours or days later, you will take another medicine.
These last for up to 6 hours.
Light bleeding may go on for a few weeks.
Some kinds of anesthesia allow you to stay awake.
After the anesthesia starts working, the doctor will put special tools into your vagina.
You can take the second medicine at home.
Some put you to sleep.
This lasts for a few hours.
When people have Raynaud disease, the blood vessels become much more narrow than usual during these times.
This is usually lighter than after a medical abortion.
The bleeding can last for up to 2 weeks.
Abortions after 14 weeks sometimes involve a longer procedure.
But they still involve medicines or surgery, or both.
But your doctor or nurse may suspect that your bites are from bedbugs when he or she looks at your skin.
In other words, they do not always get rid of all the pregnancy tissue.
A person’s heart needs to beat at a normal rate in order to pump blood to all parts of the body.
Sometimes, a person’s built-in electrical system does not work the right way.
This can cause a person’s heart to beat too slowly or too fast.
If that happens to you, you will need to have surgery to remove any leftover tissue.
Do not take anything or put anything in your vagina that is not recommended by a doctor or nurse.
But, as with any medical procedure, abortions do have some small risks.
Abortions do not harm your health, and they do not harm the health of your future babies.
But pacemakers can also prevent or control a heart rate that is too fast.
The pulse generator creates and sends electrical signals.
Electrical signals can travel from the pulse generator through the wires to the heart.
Others send electrical signals only when a person’s heart rate is too slow or too fast.
A doctor can pre-set the computer to tell the pulse generator when to send electrical signals.

The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your colon (also called large intestine).
They might also have a temporary pacemaker as a short-term treatment until they get a pacemaker put in their body.
People might have a temporary pacemaker if they have a condition that will get better soon.
He or she might do a test called an “electrocardiogram” (ECG).
This is because the battery in the pulse generator usually lasts 5 to 8 years.
It allows the doctor to look directly inside.
Wires do not usually need to be replaced.
An ECG measures the electrical activity in the heart.
This test and the other 2 mentioned above—colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy—allow the doctor to check for swelling or irritation, and for abnormal growths.
But some people with a pacemaker should not walk through a metal detector at the airport.
This electrical signal follows a path to spread across the heart.

As it spreads, the signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze.
He or she will also tell you which activities you should avoid.
Then the doctor will insert a thin tube called a “catheter” into a large artery (blood vessel) in your leg or another part of your body.
Next he or she will guide the catheter into your heart.
This destroys that tissue, so that it can no longer affect the heartbeat.
Using wires that are inside the catheter, the doctor will apply a special type of energy to the parts of the heart causing the fast heartbeat.
It is put under the skin in the upper chest and has wires that connect to the heart.
A pacemaker is a device that can keep a person’s heartbeat normal.
Eating smaller and more frequent meals can reduce the number of bowel movements you have.
You can also get more fiber by taking fiber supplements, such as Metamucil®, Citrucel®, or Benefiber®.
If you have fecal incontinence, tell your doctor or nurse.
People are sometimes too shy to bring it up.
But fecal incontinence is a real medical problem that can be treated.
They try to go even when they don’t “feel” like they need to go.
This is often helpful in women whose muscles were damaged during childbirth.
But some people with Raynaud disease also have another disease that affects their blood vessels.
During an attack, people’s fingers suddenly become cold and turn white or purple-blue.
Attacks usually begin in the index, middle, or ring fingers and then spread to the fingers in both hands.
The thumb is not usually affected.
The toes, ears, nose, face, knees, and nipples can become white or blue when they are cold.
This usually takes 15 to 20 minutes.
Their attacks can last longer, and they can develop pain or open sores on their fingers and toes.
Your doctor or nurse might also order blood tests.
You can dress warmly by wearing layers of clothes, hats, and mittens or gloves.
If you continue to have attacks after trying the things listed above, talk with your doctor or nurse.
Some people take medicine for Raynaud disease only during the cold winter months.

Do not try to get to the hospital on your own.
Having high cholesterol is just one of many things that can increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes.
This can happen if you eat a lot of beets or food dyes, or if you take certain medicines.
Then he or she threads the tube up into the bladder.
The “abdominal aorta” is the part of the aorta that goes from the heart, down through the belly, and then branches to supply blood to the legs.

Some foods and drinks have more calcium and vitamin D than others.
This helps prevent people from getting low blood sugar.
Other times, treatment is needed.
These people do not have any symptoms and do not have WPW syndrome.

People with WPW syndrome who have other heart problems can have more serious symptoms.
Doctors can diagnose WPW syndrome by doing a test called an “electrocardiogram” (ECG).
It can show if a person has an abnormal heart rhythm or rate.
Other treatments can prevent episodes of fast heartbeats from happening in the future.
During the procedure, a doctor puts thin wires into the blood vessels in the groin (inner thigh) or another part of the body.
He or she threads the wires up through the blood vessels and into the heart.
But radiofrequency catheter ablation is done more often than surgery.
When symptoms do happen, they can include pain or pressure in the lower belly on one side.
Or women might not feel them at all.
Call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if you feel intense pain in the lower belly on either side.
Sometimes, a follicle grows but does not release an egg and instead forms a cyst.
Or, if a woman gets pregnant after the egg is released, a cyst can stay on the ovary for weeks or months.
Some supplements contain either calcium or vitamin D. Others have both.
PAD involves blood vessels called “arteries” that bring blood to the legs.
Dermoid cysts are normally not harmful to your health, but your doctor might want to remove them with surgery.
These cysts usually do not go away and the cysts themselves do not need to be treated or removed.
But PCOS does sometimes require treatment for reasons unrelated to the cysts.
For example, some calcium supplements can be taken with food, but others should be taken on an empty stomach.
Plaques can cause arteries to become narrow or blocked.
This prevents blood from flowing normally.
This test uses sound waves to make a picture of your uterus and ovaries.
The pain is usually worse with walking and exercise, and gets better with rest.
Your cysts might stay the same size, get smaller, or even go away.
In those cases, you usually don’t need to do anything to treat them.
When muscles do not get enough blood, symptoms can occur.
The pictures can show if you have cysts.
Your doctor or nurse can do different tests to make sure that you have PAD, and to check if your PAD is mild or severe.
PAD can also cause pain in the feet, thighs, or buttocks.
Doctors can try different types of medicines to reduce symptoms and increase blood flow to the legs.
But people who have certain heart problems cannot take cilostazol.
They will need to take a different medicine.
These can make the belly feel hard while they are happening.
Medicines can also help people walk farther without having pain.
Different types of procedures can be done to increase blood flow to the legs and feet.
For angioplasty, a doctor threads a deflated balloon over the wire to the narrowed or blocked area.
Once there, he or she inflates the balloon.
This opens the blood vessel.
The balloon is then deflated and removed.
A stent is a wire mesh tube that stays in the body.
It is used to keep the opened vessel from closing again.
During bypass, a doctor sews a tube called a “graft” around the blocked artery.
First, your doctor or nurse might offer a medicine called oxytocin (sold as Pitocin®).
A graft can be a vein from another part of the body, or it can be manmade.
People who have the fewest long-term problems after bypass surgery include those who are younger than 70, do not have diabetes, and do not have PAD below the knee.
But many people can choose which procedure to have.
When this happens, the heart can have trouble pumping blood as well as it should.
This can lead to symptoms, such as trouble breathing, chest pain, and fainting.
It just means it does not have the condition the doctors tested for.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually caused by a genetic problem that runs in families.
When symptoms do occur, they can start during childhood, the teenage years, or adulthood.
It can show if your heart beats in a normal pattern and rhythm.
If your doctor or nurse suspects you have cardiomyopathy, he or she will probably order an “electrocardiogram” (also called an “ECG” or “EKG”).
This test measures the electrical activity in your heart.
An echo uses sound waves to create an image of the heart.
This test allows doctors to measure the thickness of the walls of the heart, measure the size of the spaces inside the heart — called chambers — and see how the heart pumps.
Kidney stones are small, hard stone-like objects that can form in a person’s kidneys.
Depending on your situation, you might also need other tests.
For example, they might take a few small doses of calcium each day instead of one large dose.
Those who do need treatment can get different kinds depending on what symptoms they have and how severe their condition is.
Women who have gone through menopause and no longer get monthly periods usually need more calcium each day than women who still get monthly periods.
Taking too much calcium or vitamin D can cause problems.
But some need to change their medicines before they start trying to have a baby.
People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes have problems, such as fainting, when they do not get enough fluids.
Ask your doctor about how much salt is OK to have in your diet.
Most women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are able to have normal pregnancies.
You should be careful to always drink enough water.
Your doctor or nurse might also want to switch your medicines.
Symptoms can be mild or severe.
In many cases, people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy need to avoid some kinds of activity.
(Later, both eyes usually develop problems.) When people with wet AMD look at straight lines, the lines actually look bent or wavy.
It affects 10 to 15 percent of people with the condition.
People who say the lines look bent could have wet AMD.
The doctor also looks for clumps called drusen, which form in the eyes of people who have AMD.
But it moves more quickly and can cause severe vision loss or even blindness.
Next, a doctor or nurse cleans the baby’s penis well.
Or they might realize that they now need bright lights or a magnifying glass to see as well as they used to.
People with dry AMD sometimes also notice spots that seem blurry.
They might notice a problem with 1 or both eyes when reading or driving.
It can show if the retina is damaged.
The test is useful because people with wet AMD sometime develop abnormal blood vessels in the retina.
It is sold without a prescription.
But there are other treatments for wet AMD.
After you get the shot, a doctor or nurse shines a special light into your eye.

But ask your doctor or nurse before you start taking it.
Your doctor will let you know if activities such as walking or biking on most days of the week can help reduce your symptoms.
He or she will compare your child’s blood pressure to the blood pressure of other children of the same age, sex, and height.
If your child’s blood pressure is much greater than the blood pressure of other children of the same age, sex, and height, your doctor or nurse will check it again on one or more other days.
That’s important, because much of the damage of wet AMD is caused by abnormal blood vessels in the retina.
Vaccines work by preparing the body to fight the germs that cause the infections.
If your child does get sick, being vaccinated can keep him or her from getting severely ill. Plus, being vaccinated also helps protect the people around your child from getting sick.
Paralysis is when people are unable to move their arms or legs.
Measles can cause a rash, fever, and cough.
It can lead to long-term problems with the lungs, ears, or brain.
Most children age 6 and younger do not need this vaccine, but some do.
But most need two or more doses to prevent an infection.
Some vaccines work after just one dose.
Depending on the type of vaccine and your child’s symptoms, your doctor or nurse might give your child the vaccine or wait until your child is better.
You can keep your list up to date by bringing it to your check-ups.
Your doctor or nurse will tell you which vaccines are safe to get.
Diabetes is a disorder that disrupts the way a person’s body uses sugar.
But some women breastfeed longer.
This causes sugar to build up in the blood.
Insulin can lower a person’s blood sugar level.
All types of insulin can control blood sugar levels.
Insulin usually comes in the form of a shot that a person gives to herself or himself.
Most of the time, the mother chooses when to wean.
But sometimes, weaning happens because a baby no longer wants to breastfeed.
Other babies can take months to wean.
But some types of insulin start working faster or last longer than other types.
Babies should not drink cow’s milk until they are 1 year old.
Many people use two different types of insulin each day so that their body has insulin all day and night.
They might still breastfeed at night or before bedtime.
Most babies younger than 6 months old are weaned to a bottle.
Most babies older than 1 year are weaned to a cup.
Babies between 6 months old and 1 year old can be weaned to a bottle or a cup.
But many people use insulin 3 or more times a day, usually before each meal.
If you have any of the above symptoms or problems, let your doctor or nurse know.
Some women have stretch marks on their breasts.
But stretch marks usually fade over time.
But it can be normal to still have some milk in your breasts for months or years after weaning.
Your baby might need extra love during this time.

In that case, your doctor or nurse will do an imaging test called an ultrasound to figure out your due date.
Your doctor can use these pictures to measure your baby’s size and figure out your due date.
Most doctors and nurses do these tests at 41 or 42 weeks, but some women have these tests earlier.
For instance, people who have alcohol poisoning can seem confused or have trouble standing up.
But some of the other symptoms of alcohol poisoning are more serious.
Suggest speaking to a doctor, nurse, or mental health expert who can help diagnose and treat a drinking problem.
The testicles are round organs that hang between a man’s legs, inside a skin sac called the scrotum.
Sperm are stored in the epididymis, which is a small organ that sits on top of the testicle.
During ejaculation, sperm travel from the epididymis through tubes and out the end of the penis.
This prevents sperm from leaving the body.
After a vasectomy, a man can still ejaculate fluid, called semen.
But the semen does not have any sperm in it.
He or she can talk with you and tell you about the procedure.
During the procedure, a doctor numbs the skin on the scrotum.
Then he or she makes a small cut in the skin to reach the vas deferens, cut it, and seal it off.
Your doctor will tell you which pain-relieving medicines to take.
After that, you must use another form of birth control for a few months to prevent pregnancy.
That’s because a vasectomy does not work right away.
He or she might also prescribe a medicine to treat your pain.
That’s because some of the tubes can still have sperm in them.
Because of this, a couple should use another type of birth control for a few months to prevent pregnancy.
For this test, a man needs to provide a sample of his semen.
But if your sample has sperm in it, you can get a woman pregnant.
You should still use birth control until you have another sperm count done.
A doctor can do surgery to reconnect the vas deferens and open the sperm’s path.
But this surgery does not always work.
To prevent getting or spreading a disease from sex, you should use a type of protection called a condom.
Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in pills.
People can get infections when they travel to other parts of the world.
Getting vaccinated can help keep you from getting sick when you travel.
The infection can cause liver problems and is sometimes fatal.
People can get it from drinking unclean water.
It can cause a fever, rash, and belly pain.
People can get it from eating or drinking unclean food or water.
Your doctor might not treat your follicular lymphoma right away if it is not causing any symptoms.
But he or she will watch your cancer closely by doing exams and blood tests until treatment is needed.
Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam.
(The drops make it easier for the doctor to see the different parts of the inside of your eye.) After the drops have done their job, the doctor looks at the back of your eye, called the retina.
Then he or she sends the pictures to an eye doctor, who checks for disease.
But people with the condition do need to keep their blood sugar and blood pressure levels as close to normal as possible.
Ideally, the checkup should include a dilated eye exam done by an eye doctor.
Doctors do this surgery if the blood vessels in the retina leak into the vitreous humor.
Normally, the bone marrow makes blood cells.
This tube, called a “central line,” will stay in place during your hospital stay.
Your doctor will use it to give you treatments, as well as take blood for tests.
The stem cells will find their way to your bone marrow.
He or she will also do blood tests each day to check that your bone marrow transplant worked.
This can cause a skin rash, diarrhea, and liver problems.
They can also make everything look slightly brown in color.
But if it looks like you have cataracts, your doctor or nurse will probably send you to an eye doctor.
An eye doctor can check you for the most common causes of vision loss by doing a “comprehensive eye exam.”
Your doctor or nurse might be able to see your cataracts just by looking in your eye.
Then work with your doctor to decide whether surgery is right for you.
These swollen nodes are often in the neck, groin, or belly.
It grows quickly, so it needs to be treated quickly.
He or she will talk with you and do an exam, blood tests, and an imaging test.
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have those symptoms, because having those symptoms could mean that the cancer has come back.
Using insulin 3 or more times a day can control a person’s blood sugar level better.
Hepatitis A can cause severe liver problems.
People can get it after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
It can cause long-terms problems with the nervous system, and is sometimes fatal.
You will need to use a needle and syringe to draw up insulin from a small bottle.
People can get it after being bitten or scratched by an infected animal.
Rabies can cause behavior changes, paralysis, or death.
A pen injector has insulin and a needle in it.
It is a way to give yourself a dose of insulin.
It can lead to long-term problems of the lungs, ears, or brain.
A “booster” is a vaccine dose given after a certain number of years.
The insulin goes through a thin tube from the pump into the body through an opening in the skin.
Most doctors recommend that people who use insulin check their blood sugar level at least 4 times a day.
People who got vaccines when younger might need booster doses before they travel.
It can also take a few months to get all the doses you need.
The device keeps working all day and night.
So it’s important to talk to your doctor about travel vaccines as soon as you know your travel plans.
Some vaccines can have egg in them because of how they are made.
If people do not use enough insulin, their blood sugar level can get too high.
Levels that are too low or too high can lead to serious problems.
But serious side effects are rare.
These monitors check your blood sugar level every few minutes using a tiny sensor that is put under the skin.
You will need to prick your skin to get a drop of blood.
This can prevent health problems later in life.
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use your blood glucose monitor.
UV light comes from the sun and can cause a sunburn when a person is in the sun for too long.
People can also get a sunburn on a cloudy day, because UV light can go through clouds.
Tanning beds use UV light to give people a tan.
Most skin cancers can be treated easily.
Depending on your symptoms, he or she will tell you if you can treat your sunburn at home or if you need to see a doctor.
Then reapply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours, or after you sweat or swim.
When people have AML, their bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells instead of normal blood cells.
Then another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if abnormal (cancer) cells are present.
This means that doctors do not see any abnormal blood cells in the blood or bone marrow.
But even though doctors do not see any abnormal cells, there are still abnormal cells in the body.
To kill these cells and prevent the AML from returning, people need more treatment.
Regular follow-ups include talking with your doctor, exams, and blood tests.
Sometimes, your doctor will also do a bone marrow biopsy.

Both girls and boys can get the HPV vaccine.
If your child does get sick, being vaccinated can keep him or her from getting severely ill. Plus, being vaccinated helps protect the people around your child from getting sick.
Most children age 7 to 18 do not need this vaccine.
But children who have certain medical conditions might need it.
If your child never got this vaccine at a younger age, he or she might need to get it.
It reminds the body how to prevent an infection.
A “booster” is a vaccine dose given after a number of years.
For example, many girls get the HPV vaccine at age 11 or 12.
But they can get it any time from age 9 to 26.
Others need two or more doses to prevent an infection.
Others stop working well after some time.
Some vaccines have egg in them because of how they are made.
Many schools and camps need this information before they let a child in.

It often makes you feel like you are about to fall or pass out.
Dizziness can also cause you to feel lightheaded or make it hard for you to walk straight.
These feelings come and go, and may last seconds, hours, or days.
You may feel worse when you move your head, change positions, cough, or sneeze.
This system tells the brain what position the body is in.
Vertigo makes you feel like you are spinning, swaying, or tilting, or like the room is moving around you.
Floating inside that fluid are special calcium deposits.
For example, the doctor can give you medicines to relieve nausea and vomiting.
This treatment teaches you exercises that can help you cope with your vertigo.
To reduce the risk of falls, make your home as safe as possible.
It describes what happens when you pass out.
Get rid of loose electrical cords, clutter, and slippery rugs.
Also, make sure that you wear sturdy, non-slip shoes, and that your walkways are clear and well lit.
After fainting, a person quickly “comes to” and is OK again.
About 1 out of every 3 people has it at some point in life.
This is called “vasovagal syncope.”
Long, thin wires connect the pads to a machine.
This can show if the pattern of your heartbeats is abnormal.
He or she will also want to know what medicines you are taking.
The device records the electrical activity in your heart.
You will keep doing normal activities.
Then, you can avoid those activities or find better ways to deal with them.
They keep blood from pooling in your legs.
You might not need treatment.
They help the heart beat at a normal speed or in a regular pattern.
Thin wires attach them to your heart.
But your child might have a heart condition that is causing syncope.
The only difference is that this test looks only at the first part of the colon, and a colonoscopy looks at the whole colon.
They do not usually cause symptoms.
But some polyps can be or become cancer, so doctors sometimes remove them.
The tube also has tools on the end, so the doctor can remove pieces of tissue, including polyps.
After polyps are removed, they usually go to a lab to be tested for cancer and other problems.
This test creates pictures of the colon.
Roughly one-third to one-half of all adults have them.
If a stool test indicates that something might be wrong with the colon, doctors usually follow up with a colonoscopy.
It can also happen around other joints in the body.
Then doctors find polyps, if they are there.
In some people polyps come back.
And if you had the kind of polyps that could become cancer, your doctor will want to remove them as they appear.
Also, if the polyps you had removed were the kind that could become cancer, people in your family might need to be checked for polyps and colon cancer, too.
Most of the time, bursitis happens around the shoulder, elbow, hip, or knee.
It cushions and protects nearby tissues when they rub on or slide over bones.
Bursitis happens when a bursa gets irritated and swollen.
If that happens, the pouch can swell and in some cases burst.
That’s dangerous, because a burst appendix can cause widespread infection.
Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam.
Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and check the skin all over your body.
If he or she suspects you have skin cancer, you will have a follow-up test called a biopsy.
Then he or she can do lab tests on the fluid to find out what is causing the bursitis, and if you need antibiotics.
But if you do have appendicitis, he or she will probably be able to diagnose it just by doing an exam.
Your doctor or nurse can learn a lot about your condition by pressing on your belly and talking with you about your symptoms.
Call your doctor or nurse if you have the symptoms listed above.
People who sit for a long time can sit on a cushioned chair.
A physical therapist can teach you stretches and exercises to help reduce your symptoms.
Then he or she inserts long, thin tools into the belly.

One of the tools has a camera (called a “laparoscope”) on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen.
The doctor can look at the image on the screen to know where to cut and what to remove.
Then he or she uses the long tools to do the surgery.
It can happen when germs get into the skin.
Normally, different types of germs live on a person’s skin.
Most of the time, these germs do not cause any problems.
But if a person gets a cut or a break in the skin, the germs can get into the skin and cause an infection.
Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and look at your skin.
If you do not take all the pills, the infection can come back worse.
The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.
When you sleep, keep your head and neck in line with your body.
Each causes different symptoms.
Cellulitis is one type of skin infection, but there are others.
The right treatment depends on the type of infection a person has and the germs causing it.
Take all of the pills you are given, even if you feel better before you finish them.
That will not work either.
This can help prevent the area from getting infected.
If you have a long-term skin condition, ask your doctor or nurse what you can do to help prevent getting cellulitis.
If the chest X-ray shows a spot that looks like it could be cancer, he or she will probably follow up with other tests.
It can cause leg pain, varicose veins, swollen legs, or open sores.
Normally, the veins in the legs carry blood from the legs back to the heart.
The veins have tiny valves inside them to help keep blood moving in only one direction (toward the heart).
The valves open to let blood flow to the heart, and close to keep it from flowing back down the leg.
Vein disease can happen when the valves are damaged or do not work well.
Blood is especially likely to collect in the legs when people sit or stand for a long time without walking.
Your doctor will need to wash away the material that spills out when an appendix bursts.
Your doctor might test you to see if you have a kind of lung cancer that would respond to these medicines.
You should also watch for the symptoms listed above, because having those symptoms could mean the cancer has come back.
But your doctor or nurse can figure out if you have IBS by asking you a few questions, and by running tests to make sure you do not have something other than IBS.
So it is important that your doctor or nurse check the other possibilities.
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.
Ask your doctor or nurse for advice on which foods can make IBS worse.
You can do this by eating more fruits and vegetables.
Or you can take fiber pills or powders.
Skin color changes often happen first around the ankle.
The key is to keep working with your doctor or nurse until the two of you find an approach that works.
Your doctor or nurse will do an exam to look at your legs.
He or she might also do a test called an ultrasound.
But nosebleeds are not usually serious.
An ultrasound can check how well the valves in the legs work.
It can also see if any of the veins in the legs are blocked.
DO NOT grip the bridge of your nose between your eyes.
That will not work.
DO NOT press on just one side, even if the bleeding is only on one side.
If you keep checking, you will ruin your chances of getting the bleeding to stop.

Your doctor or nurse might also recommend that your child take a vitamin every day.
But as the cancer grows, the symptoms become worse.
If cancer is present, the doctor will usually continue surgery and treat the cancer by removing as much of it as possible.

For example, people who use a certain type of insulin or who take diabetes pills that increase insulin levels (called “sulfonylureas”) should eat meals at the same time each day.
Usually, these medicines go into a vein.
But sometimes they can go through a small tube into the lower part of the stomach.
Your doctor or nurse can work with you to find programs or people who can help with these types of problems.
That’s because people who use these treatments have a smaller chance of getting low blood sugar.
You might also have a medicine called targeted therapy, which can help prevent cancer growth.
Bloating is the feeling of fullness and cramping in the belly that can happen with gas.
But some of it contains a substance called sulfur.
But in this case the damage is related to having blood sugar levels that are too high.
Presbyopia often occurs as a result of aging.

These samples are also checked under a microscope for cancer.
It will also depend on your age and other health problems.
Sometimes, your doctor will also do blood tests and imaging tests.
But a tick can infect you only if it stays attached for at least a day.
Blood tests can show if you are infected with the germ that causes Lyme disease.

A couple might not be able to get pregnant because of an issue with the man’s body, the woman’s body, or both.
But even with tests, doctors sometimes cannot figure out why a couple can’t get pregnant.
For example, some men have a block in a structure called the “vas deferens,” which is the tube that sperm needs to travel through.
Then the doctor can look at the sample under a microscope to check if sperm are present.
Or women might have blocked fallopian tubes from past infections or surgery.
Or the tests might not show what the problem is.
You might find it helpful to learn ways to relax, or to go to a support group for people who are trying to get pregnant.

The doctor uses this tube to measure the pressure inside your arteries and heart.
The doctor might also inject a dye into your arteries that shows up on an X-ray.
Coronary angiography can show whether any of the arteries in your heart are clogged.
In some cases, the doctor will also take a tiny piece of heart muscle (a “biopsy”).
This can help the doctor find the cause of your cardiomyopathy.
For example, in people who have cardiomyopathy caused by alcohol use, an important part of treatment is avoiding alcohol.
